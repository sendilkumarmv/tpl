* It is required to wait by nature on something that is not available at a particular time before trying to get it.
* `Thread.Sleep(int timeInMilliSecond)`
  1. Sleep pauses the thread to execute this code, and notifies the scheduler to allow another thread to execute.
  2. It is synchronous, it blocks the current thread.
     
* `Thread.SpinWait(Int32)` -> Not covering as it more of Threading not TPL
  
* `Task.Delay(int timein MilliSecond)`
  1. Creates a task that is completed after a specified time. It is used to introduce an asynchronous delay.
  2. Itâ€™s non-blocking, so the calling thread can continue executing other code while the delay is in effect.

      `Delay(Int32)`	
      Creates a task that completes after a specified number of milliseconds.
      
      `Delay(TimeSpan)`	
      Creates a task that completes after a specified time interval.
      
      `Delay(Int32, CancellationToken)`	
      Creates a cancellable task that completes after a specified number of milliseconds.
      
      `Delay(TimeSpan, CancellationToken)`	
      Creates a cancellable task that completes after a specified time interval.
      
      `Delay(TimeSpan, TimeProvider)`
      Creates a task that completes after a specified time interval.
      
      `Delay(TimeSpan, TimeProvider, CancellationToken)`
      Creates a cancellable task that completes after a specified time interval.

  * `SpinWait.SpinUntil()` -> will go in detail during synchronization
